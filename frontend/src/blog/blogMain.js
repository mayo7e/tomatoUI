                    A stack trace is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a computer program. It can be used to determine the sequence of function calls that led to a specific point in the code being reached, and can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting errors that occur during the execution of a program.

A stack trace consists of a list of stack frames, with each frame representing a function call. The top frame of the stack trace represents the function that is currently being executed, while the bottom frame represents the first function that was called when the program started. Each frame includes the name of the function, the file and line number where the function is defined, and any arguments that were passed to the function.

To generate a stack trace, a program can use a special function provided by the operating system or programming language runtime. In some cases, a stack trace can also be generated automatically by the runtime when an error occurs, such as an exception being thrown or a segmentation fault occurring.

Stack traces can be used to identify the root cause of an error by examining the sequence of function calls that led up to the error. They can also be used to trace the execution of a program in order to understand how it works or to identify performance bottlenecks.
